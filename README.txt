The WMS uses jQuery 1.10.3 custom and 1.9.1
You must download and install those separately.
You can get them from the jqueryui.com web site
Create your own custom theme and download.

You should get a development-bundle directory and css to upload.

Example include:
"css/redmond/jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.css" rel="stylesheet"
 src="js/jquery-1.9.1.js"
 src="js/jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.js">
